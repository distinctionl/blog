    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of you will have heard about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25908379">Google&rsquo;s £400m purchase</a> of <a href="http://deepmind.com">DeepMind</a>, a startup founded to solve Artificial Intelligence (AI). They focussed on developing algorithms that would allow machines to learn how to play computer games. It&rsquo;s this generality which makes their approach AI rather than Machine Learning (ML). And apparently the computer gets pretty good, eventually beating human players.</p>

<p>What intrigues me is how this technology works. Of course much of it is a closely guarded secret, but prior to being bought, DeepMind did file three patents, so I thought it would be interesting to read these. In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll be taking a look at the first of them, <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20140185959">US20140185959</a>.</p>
